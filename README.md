# FrontEndFinland

Welcome to the FrontEndFinland repository! This is my first front-end development focused project following the instructions of the LUT university Front-End course.
It has been primarly created using node and sass to compile the css styles being the goal creating a basic portfolio.

## How to run the project

To run the project locally, you will need to have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version v21.2.0)
- npm (Node Package Manager installed along node)
- Python (version 3.12.0)

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Compile the SCSS files into CSS files by running `npm run sass`.
5. Finally, open the `index.html` file in your browser or use a live server extension to view the project.
